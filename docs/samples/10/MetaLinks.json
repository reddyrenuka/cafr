An objective of using the net (expense) revenue format is to report the relative financial burden of each of the reporting government's functions on its taxpayers. This format identifies the extent to which each function of the government draws from the general revenues of the government or is self-financing through fees and intergovernmental aid. This notion of burden on the reporting government's taxpayers is important in determining what is program or general revenue. General revenues, contributions to term and permanent endowments, contributions to permanent fund principal, special and extraordinary items, and transfers should be reported separately after the total net expenses of the government's functions, ultimately arriving at the \"change in net position\" for the period. At a minimum, the statement of activities should present:\n \n a.
